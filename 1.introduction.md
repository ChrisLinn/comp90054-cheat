# Week 1 Introduction

# Outline
+ Introduction to AI and (AI) Planning
+ Classical Planning as Heuristic Search and Width-Based Search
+ Beyond Classical Planning
    * Factored-Model-Free
    * Non Determinism
    * Uncertainty
    * Soft goals
    * Plan Recognition
    * Epistemic (social) Planning
+ Reinforcement Learning: Learning through Experience

# Prerequisite
+ Algo (DP)
+ Set Theory
+ Propositional Logic
+ Probabilistic Theory

# Complexity
+ P
    * can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic machine
+ NP
    * can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic machine
    * can be solved (guessed) in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine
+ NP-hard
    * which all NPs can be reduced to 
    * might not be NP
    * at least as hard as NP
+ NP-complete
    * in both NP and NP-hard
+ P=NP?
    * whether polynomial time algorithms actually exist for solving NP-complete
    * If P=NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in “creative leaps,” __no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it’s found__. __Everyone__ who could appreciate a symphony would be __Mozart__; __everyone__ who could follow a step-by-step argument would be __Gauss__ ... —— Scott Aaronson, MIT

# AI
+ automation of intelligent behavior
    * make rational action choices
+ Rational agents
    * Agents
        - do what
            + sensors -(perceive environment)-> percepts
            + actuators -(act upon environment)-> actions
        - examples
            + humans
            + animals
            + robots
            + software agents (softbots)
    * best case (‘the right thing’) is often unattainable
        - Rationality vs. Omniscience
        - Performance measure × Percepts × Knowledge → Action
+ what do AI do
    * Humanly vs Rationally
    * Thinking vs Acting
+ Solver
    * general
    * deals with any problem expressed as an instance of model (families of problems)
        - Linear Equations Model
            + tractable
+ AI solver
    * intractable
    * tasks
        - Constraint Satisfaction/SAT
            + find state that satisfies constraints
            + NP-Complete
                * worst-case exponential in number of variables
            + --(generalized with non-boolean, non-clause constraints)--> CSPs
            + key
                * efficient inference (poly-time)
                    - unit resolution
                    - conflict-based learning
        - Planning Problems
            + find action sequence that produces desired state
        - Planning with Feedback
            + find strategy for producing desired state
    * challenge
        - scalability
            + need to recognize and exploit the problems
                * lots of ideas
                    - effective inference methods
                        + derivation of h
                        + conflict-learning
                    - islands of tractability
                        + treewidth methods and relaxations
                    - transformations
                        + compiling away incomplete info
                        + extended goals
                * but methodology empirical
                    - benchmarks
                    - competitions
+ Planning
    * model-based
    * NP-hard
    * planner
    * classical planning & ai planing
