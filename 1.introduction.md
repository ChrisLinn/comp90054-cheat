# Prerequisite
+ Algo (DP)
+ Set Theory
+ Propositional Logic
+ Probabilistic Theory

# AI
+ automation of intelligent behavior
    *  make rational action choices
+ Rational agents
    * Agents
        - do what
            + sensors -(perceive environment)-> percepts
            + actuators -(act upon environment)-> actions
        - examples
            + humans
            + animals
            + robots
            + software agents (softbots)
    * best case (‘the right thing’) is often unattainable
        - Rationality vs. Omniscience
        - Performance measure × Percepts × Knowledge → Action
+ what do AI do
    * Humanly vs Rationally
    * Thinking vs Acting
+ Solver
    * general
    * deals with any problem expressed as an instance of model (families of problems)
        - Linear Equations Model
            + tractable
+ AI solver
    * intractable
    * tasks
        - Constraint Satisfaction/SAT
            + find state that satisfies constraints
            + NP-Complete
                * worst-case exponential in number of variables
            + --(generalized with non-boolean, non-clause constraints)--> CSPs
            + key
                * efficient inference (poly-time)
                    - unit resolution
                    - conflict-based learning
        - Planning Problems
            + find action sequence that produces desired state
        - Planning with Feedback
            + find strategy for producing desired state
    * challenge
        - scalability
            + need to recognize and exploit the problems
                * lots of ideas
                    - effective inference methods
                        + derivation of h
                        + conflict-learning
                    - islands of tractability
                        + treewidth methods and relaxations
                    - transformations
                        + compiling away incomplete info
                        + extended goals
                * but methodology empirical
                    - benchmarks
                    - competitions
+ Planning
    * model-based
    * NP-hard
    * planner
    * classical planning & ai planing
