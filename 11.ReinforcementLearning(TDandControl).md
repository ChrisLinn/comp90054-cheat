# 11 - Reinforcement Learning (TD and Control)

+ Temporal Difference Learning
    * Use experience
        - Combination of Monte Carlo (MC) ideas and Dynamic Programming (DP)
            + MC
                * learn from raw experience
                * without a model
            + DP
                * update estimates based on other learned estimates
                * no waiting for Ô¨Ånal outcome (bootstrap)
