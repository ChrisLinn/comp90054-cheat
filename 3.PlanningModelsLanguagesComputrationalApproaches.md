# Planning Models, Languages and Computrational Approaches

+ Programming-based: Specify control by hand
+ Learning-based: Learn control from experience
+ Model-based: Specify problem by hand, derive control automatically
    * Model-Based Approach / General Problem Solving
    * pros
        - intelligent & domain-independent
    * cons
        - efficiency loss

## Conformanr Planning
+ uncertainty but no feedback
+ any possible initial
+ more complex than classical

## Planning with  MDPs

## POMDPs


## diff
+ action de, location known
+ action stochastic,
+ action stochastic,
