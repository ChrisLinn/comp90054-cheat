# AlphaGo

## Go is hard
+ Search space is huge
+ hard to evaluate (who is winning)
    * difficult to design evaluation functions

## AlphaGo
+ Monte-Carlo rollouts
+ Value network
    * Reducing depth
    * 12 layer convolutional neural network
+ Policy network
    * Reducing breadth
    * 12 layer convolutional neural network
