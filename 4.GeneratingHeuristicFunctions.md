# Generating Heuristic Functions

+ constrcuct heurisctic
    * ralaxing
        - derive heuristic automatically
            + generality
            + autonomy
            + flexibility
            + rapid prototyping
        - how to relax formaly
            + simpler whose `h'*` can be used to estimate  `h*`
            +  `h`(Π) := `h'*`(r(Π))
                * native?
                * efﬁciently constructible?
                    - approximate
                    - redesign
                    - hope for the best
                * efﬁciently computable?
                    - approximate
