# Generating Heuristic Functions

+ constrcuct heurisctic
    * ralaxing
        - derive heuristic automatically
            + generality
            + autonomy
            + flexibility
            + rapid prototyping
        - how to relax formaly
            + simpler whose `h'*` can be used to estimate  `h*`
            +  `h`(Π) := `h'*`(r(Π))
                * native?
                * efﬁciently constructible?
                    - approximate
                    - redesign
                    - hope for the best
                * efﬁciently computable?
                    - approximate
                        + V
                    - redesign
                        + V
                    - hope for the best
                        + not used
            + how to relax during search
+ goal counting
    * drop both DELETE & PRECONDITION
+ delete relaxation h+
    * safe
    * goal ware
    * may not be admissible
+ minimum spanning tree
    * 我们这里用的是 "考虑了 delete relaxation" 的 minimum spanning tree (steiner tree vs minimum spanning tree?)
    * TSP 中 h+ 就是 minimum spanning tree
    * 但 pacman 中不行， 应该算 goals 的 minimum spanning tree 
        - 不然多个 goals 时 h 下降得比 cost 快
+ h1
    * 到那个 state 的最小开销
    * 计算出来和 h^{max} 一样
+ h^{max}
+ h^{add}
+ hff
    * sum of the costs for all unique actions in a (relaxed) plan
