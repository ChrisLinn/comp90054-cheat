# Epistemic Planning

## Classical Planning
+ Deterministic events
+ Environments change only as the result of an action
+ Perfect knowledge
    * omniscience
+ Single actor
    * omnipotence

## Epistemic Planning
+ modeling knowledge or belief
    * drop the assumption of perfect knowledge 
        - partially observable
        - why
            + ~~no autonomous entity ever has it~~
            + ~~many hard problems in autonomy & AI involve finding out information that we don’t know~~
                * ~~locating survivors in a disaster and providing them with aid~~
            + ~~can never tell everything that another ‘agent’ (human or artificial) knows~~
    * different actors have different beliefs or knowledge about the environment and each other
        - (start to) drop the assumption of single actor (but only a bit)
            + multi-agent
                * but still single controller
    * may not change the environment
        - can have epistemic (doxastic) actions
            + may not be physical/ontic actions
