# Epistemic Planning

## Classical Planning
+ Deterministic events
+ Environments change only as the result of an action
+ Perfect knowledge
    * omniscience
+ Single actor
    * omnipotence

## Epistemic Planning
drop the assumption of perfect knowledge, and (start to) drop the assumption of single actor (but only a bit).

+ ~~why not assume perfect knowledge~~
    * ~~no autonomous entity ever has it~~
    * ~~many hard problems in autonomy & AI involve finding out information that we don’t know~~
        - ~~locating survivors in a disaster and providing them with aid~~
    * ~~can never tell everything that another ‘agent’ (human or artificial) knows~~





+ Epistemic = knowledge or belief
    -> multi-agent

+ single actor
    * multi-agent
        - single controller
+ fully observable
    * partially observable

model belief of others
