# Reinforcement Learning

How to learn without a model

## Motivation
+ unknown environment
    * you don't have a model
+ Reinforcement Learning ~ Learning + Planning

## MCTS vs RL
+ Monte Carlo Tree Search samples a Policy Tree through experience. Recomputes Tree for evey new state.
+ Reinforcement Learning learns a full policy mapping states to actions through experience.

## Reinforcement Learning
+ don't know the environment
+ know the states
+ influence the env with actions, receive feedbacks(rewards)
+ Temporal Difference Learning
    * Use experience
        - Combination of Monte Carlo (MC) ideas and Dynamic Programming (DP)
            + MC
                * learn from raw experience
                * without a model
            + DP
                * update estimates based on other learned estimates
                * no waiting for Ô¨Ånal outcome (bootstrap)
