# Search Algorithms

## Classical Planning
+ Basic State Model
    * directed graphs
+ search algo
    * Blind search vs. heuristic (or informed) search
        - Blind search
            + DFS
            + BFS
            + Uniform cost (Dijkstra)
            + Iterative Deepening (ID)
        - Heuristic search
            + A*
            + IDA*
            + Hill Climbing
            + Best First
            + WA*
            + DFS B&B
            LRTA*
    * Systematic search vs. local search


+ eval
    * Guarantees
        - Completeness
        - Optimality
    * Complexity
        - time
            + how many __generated__ states
        - space
            + how many states

+ BFS
    * Guarantees
        - complete
        - optimal for uniform action cost
    * complexity
        - time
        - space

+ DFX
    * Guarantees
        - complete when no cycles
        - no
