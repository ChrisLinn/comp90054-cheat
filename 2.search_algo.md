# Search Algorithms

## Classical Planning
+ Basic State Model
    * directed graphs
+ search algo
    * Blind search vs. Heuristic (or informed) search
        - Blind search
            + DFS
            + BFS
            + Uniform cost (Dijkstra)
            + Iterative Deepening (ID)
        - Heuristic search
            + A*
            + IDA*
            + Hill Climbing
            + Best First
            + WA*
            + DFS B&B
            + LRTA*
    * Systematic search vs. Local search
        - Systematic search
            + consider a large number of search nodes simultaneously
        - Local search
            + work with one (or a few) candidate solutions (search nodes) at a time
        - can overlap
            + hill-climbing
    + when to use?
        * satisfying planning
            - Heuristic >> Blind
            - Systematic ~ Local
        * optimal planning
            - Heuristic > Blind
            - has to be Systematic

## Terminology
+ Search node
+ Path cost
+ Optimal cost
+ Node expansion
+ Search strategy
+ Open list (Frontier)
+ Closed list (explored set)
    * only used in graph search
        - not in tree search

## Progression vs. Regression
+ progression
    * forward
    * default in this course
    * search states = world states
+ regression
    * backward
    * search states = sub-goals we would need to achieve
        -  search states != world states

## Search States != Search Nodes
Search Nodes = Parent + Action + Cost + Search States

## Evaluation
* Guarantees
    - Completeness
        + can find a solution
    - Optimality
* Complexity
    - time
        + how many __generated__ states
    - space
        + how many states
        - factors
            + Branching factor
            + Goal depth

+ BFS
    * Guarantees
        - complete
        - optimal for uniform action cost
    * complexity
        - time
        - space

+ DFX
    * Guarantees
        - complete when no cycles
        - no
