# Search Algorithms

## Classical Planning
+ Basic State Model
    * directed graphs
        - search algo: path-finding in graph
            + heuristic (or informed) search
+ search algo
    * Blind search vs. heuristic (or informed) search
    * Systematic search vs. local search


+ eval
    * Guarantees
        - Completeness
        - Optimality
    * Complexity
        - time
            + how many __generated__ states
        - space
            + how many states

+ BFS
    * Guarantees
        - complete
        - optimal for uniform action cost
    * complexity
        - time
        - space

+ DFX
    * Guarantees
        - complete when no cycles
        - no
