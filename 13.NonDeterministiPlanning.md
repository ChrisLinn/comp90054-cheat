# Non-deterministic planning
actions with uncertain outcomes where we donâ€™t have probabilities

##  Motivation
+ Classical Planning
    * Deterministic events
    * Environments change only as the result of an action
    * Perfect knowledge (omniscience, the state of knowing everything)
    * Single actor (omnipotence, the quality of having unlimited or very great power)
+ MDPs
    * Drop deterministism
+ FOND, Fully-Observable Non-Deterministic Planning
    * Drop probabilities further
