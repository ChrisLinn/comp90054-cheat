+ policy
    * a plan is a policy
        - it is just that it is defined only for the states along which the plan is derived. E.g. given the plan "s --a--> s' --b--> s'' --c --> s''', it can be represented as the policy:
            ```
                s -> a
                s' -> b
                s'' -> c
            ```
